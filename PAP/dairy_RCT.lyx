Incentivizing quality in dairy value chains - experimental evidence from Uganda (registered report)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In value chains where quality of the underlying commodity is hard to observe and track,
 quality upgrading my be challenging.
 We test two barriers to the development of a market for quality in Ugandan dairy value chains using a field experiment with treatments at different levels.
 At the farmer level,
 we conjecture that farmers are paying attention to the wrong quality attributes and design a video-based information campaign to point out the quality parameters that matter for processors.
 We also provide them with a small incentive to put what they learned into practice.
 Midstream,
 at milk collection centers where milk is bulked and chilled,
 we provide technology aimed at facilitating quality discovery and tracking.
 We look at impact of both interventions at both farmer and milk collection center level and consider outcomes such as milk quality,
 prices received and quantities transacted.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quality of products transacted within value chains,
 and the preservation of quality throughout the chain,
 is central to value chain development.
 Working with quality inputs often reduces production costs further down the value chain.
 Quality inputs and safeguarding quality while processing,
 storing,
 and transporting commodities is also important from a food safety perspective.
 In general,
 transformation of value chains often coincide with significant quality upgrading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the past decade,
 the dairy sub-sector in Uganda has changed dramatically.
 Particularly in the areas around Mbarara,
 commonly referred to as the southwestern milk shed,
 an influx of foreign direct investment has created the preconditions for modern dairy value chains to emerge 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The area now has an extensive network of milk cooling and collection centers that link smallholder farmers to a cluster of processors.
 In the dairy value chain,
 quality is particularly important.
 Milk quality determines how much end product (eg cheese,
 caseine,
 milk powder,..) can be obtained from a given quantity of milk.
 Furthermore,
 it goes without saying that the protection of milk from dirt and contamination is important for food safety,
 as milk is very unstable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time,
 it is surprising that there seems to be no market for quality in the Ugandan dairy sub-sector (while this is generally the case in more developed dairy value chain where the price is not a fixed price per liter of milk supplied.
 Generally,
 payment differs per dairy farmer,
 depending on the protein and fat and lactose content of the milk supplied by the farmer

).
 For instance,
 using recently collected survey data,
 we find that of a sample of 200 farmers that sold to milk collection centers,
 only 6 percent indicated that they received a quality premium.
 From 114 milk collection centers that were included in that survey,
 we found that only about 18 percent (sometimes) paid a price premium to farmers.
 At the same time,
 expert interviews with processors indicate that their main challenge is related to sourcing milk of sufficient quality,
 pointing out issues related to butter fat content and solid non-fat content of the milk.
 They also say that the would be willing to pay for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When asked about what farmers need to do to increase quality,
 farmers mainly refer to practices that affect milk sanitation.
 Most training and extension activities in the area focus on the importance of using proper equipment (stainless steel milk churns as opposed to plastic jerry cans) and simple practices such as washing hands and udders.
 These technologies and practices do not affect the milk quality attributes that processors seem to care most about.
 To increase butter fat content and solid non-fat content,
 it is especially feeding practices that matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above points to at least two problems which constrain the development of a market for quality milk.
 First,
 at a technological level,
 instruments necessary to make the desired quality attributes visible are lacking.
 Most milk collection centers only engage in rudimentary testing for adulteration (using a gravity based test with a device called a lactometer) and freshness (using the alcohol test).
 Farmers do not have access to testing equipment.
 Second,
 at the knowledge level,
 farmers do not seem to know what quality parameters are important further downstream the value chain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this research,
 we will test various hypothesis using a randomized control trial with interventions at both the level of the milk collection centers and at the farmer level.
 At the level of the milk collection center,
 we work with the Uganda Dairy Development Authority (DDA) to scale up their Quality-Based Milk Payment Scheme (QBMPS) that was piloted by last year in Ugandaâ€™s SW milkshed.
 It involves installing lactoscans at milk collection centers that allows testing of individual milk deliveries for quality parameters desired by processors.
 We want to test what the impact of visualizing these quality attributes at this level is on both farmers and milk collection centers.
 We then use a split plot design to mix in a second intervention at the level of the farmers.
 Here,
 we provide a video-based information treatment where farmers are informed about what quality parameters processors deem important and how they can improve on these parameters,
 and incentivize them by giving a bag of pasture seed.

 explore the effect of collective incentives on group production among rural Indian dairy cooperatives.
 In a randomized evaluation,
 they find village-level cooperatives can solve internal collective action problems to improve production quality.
 However,
 some village elites decline payments when they cannot control information disclosure.
 Opting out reflects frictions in allocating surplus within a social network,
 and suggests some transparency-based efforts to limit elite capture may undermine policy goals.

 In the Indonesian dairy value chains they study,
 individual quality incentives increased the compositional quality of milk quickly after its introduction.
 Together with physical inputs and training,
 individual quality incentives also increased the hygienic quality of milk.

 use framed field experiment to evaluate the impact of two incentive instruments:
 a price penalty for low quality and a bonus for consistent high quality milk on farmersâ€™ investment in quality-improving inputs among contract farmers in the Vietnamese dairy sector.
 Statistical analysis suggests that the penalty drives farmers into higher input use,
 resulting in better output quality.
 The bonus payment generates even higher quality milk.

\begin_layout Section*
Hypotheses and impact pathways
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One potential reason why a market for quality does not develop may be related to the fact that milk from individual farmers is poured together,
 making it hard to track quality.
 In general,
 at the start of the cold chain in milk collection centers,
 only rudimentary testing is done,
 and equipment to track quality parameters that are most relevant for the development of a market for quality is lacking.
 Only when milk reaches the processor,
 these quality parameters are revealed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first hypothesis,
 we expect that reducing the cost of quality discovery at the level of the milk collection center (such that it is easy to accurately determine the quality of each individual supplier before it is aggregated in milk tanks) will increase outcomes at that level for several reasons.
 For instance,
 it will enable collection centers to turn down suppliers with low quality,
 which should increase the overall quality of milk aggregated.
 When milk collection centers are able to independently assess the quality of the milk,
 they may actively search for processors that are prepared to pay a premium for a particular quality parameter.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As mentioned earlier,
 milk quality determines what products can be produced.
 If the milk collection center discovers their milk has a particularly high butter fat content,
 it may decide to deliver to a cheese producer who is prepared to pay more for high fat milk than a processor that extracts caseine who is more interested in SNF.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In addition,
 accurate information about the quality of the milk may also strengthen the bargaining position of the milk collection center vis-a-vis the buyer.
 The ability to accurately monitor incoming milk may also enable milk collection centers to engage in product differentiation at an early stage,
 by for instance using one tank to collect high protein milk destined for casseine extraction and using another tank to collect milk that is high in butter fat,
 to supply to a cheese maker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second hypothesis,
 we also expect that dairy farmers will benefit from this intervention at the level of the milk collection centers.
 Making quality visible midstream should enable milk collection centers to reward farmers for supplying superior milk and increase the overall quality of the milk that the collection center aggregates.
 If dairy farmers know that the milk collection center has the equipment to test milk at a reasonable cost,
 farmers may also demand milk collection centers to test their milk in case there is discussion related to the quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another potential reason why a market for quality does not develop may be related to the fact that farmers do not have adequate knowledge about what is meant by milk quality.
 In particular,
 farmers seem to focus most on food safety related quality aspects of milk,
 and less on the compositional aspect.
 As a result,
 even when the technology to assess quality is available,
 farmers may not be able to improve without additional knowledge on what parameters to improve upon.
 Furthermore,
 it may be that farmers do not have a good understanding of how these compositional parameters can be affected.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Being a non-rival good,
 information is generally undersuplied by the private sector.
 Agricultural extension and advisory services are therefore often organized by governments or nongovernmental organizations who tend to prioritize food safety concerns over profitability.
 As a result,
 farmers are mostly trained on how to maintain milk sanitary standards and less on ways to improve quality in terms of butter fat and Solid Non-Fat.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A third hypothesis is thus that providing information on what the desired milk quality parameters are,
 and what affects these parameters,
 increases outcomes for farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In value chains,
 it is not always clear whether upgrading is driven by push (eg a productivity increasing technological innovation at the farm level) or pull factors (eg in increase in demand due to opening up of export markets).
 Often,
 it is a combination of both,
 and push and pull factors endogenously reinforce each other in a virtuous cycle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12638"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In a final hypothesis,
 we thus also test if making quality visible at the milk collection center level and at the same time providing information on what the desired milk quality parameters are increases outcomes for farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Experimental design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field experiment consists of two cross-randomized interventions that are implemented at different levels.
 Outcomes may be measures at different levels.
 The design is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

,
 which provides a stylized representation of the dairy value chain.
 We randomly allocate quality testing equipment to a random subset of milk collection centers (MCCs),
 while another random subset of milk collection centers functions as the control group for this treatment.
 In the catchment area of each milk collection center,
 we then take a sample of dairy farmers,
 stratifying the sample on whether the farmer is an active supplier to the milk collection center or not.
 In this sample,
 we then randomly assign half of the farmers to the information treatment (blocking on whether the farmer is an active supplier to the milk collection center or not).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this design,
 we can then test if the intervention at the milk collection center improved outcomes for milk collection centers.
 We can also test if the intervention at the milk collection center affects outcomes at the farmer level by comparing outcomes of the farmers in catchment areas of treated Milk Collection Centers (MCCs) to outcomes of farmers in catchment areas of control MCCs.
 The intervention at the farmer level can only be evaluated at the farmer level.
 At the level of the farmers,
 we can also look at the interaction between the two treatments by looking at outcomes of farmers that received the information treatment in catchment areas of milk collection centers that also received a lactoscan in relation to outcomes of farmers that are differently exposed to the treatments.

In sum,
 and in reference to the equation we will estimate in the next section,
 the four main hypotheses that we will test with this design are:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional research questions,
 based on the stratification,
 tests for differences in average treatment effects between farmers that are connected to milk collection centers versus those that are not.
 Testing for this treatment heterogeneity allows us to explore if the interventions only strengthen existing value chains or whether they can also draw in actors from informal value chains.

Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make relevant quality parameters visible at the level of the milk collection centers,
 we focus on a technology bundle.
 In close collaboration with DDA,
 we install milk analyzers at a random sample of milk collection centers.
 These can be used to test milk samples of individual farmers or traders that supply to the milk collection centers to establish quality of incoming milk,
 as well as to test samples from the milk tankers when milk is picked up by traders or processors.
 Milk analyzers show butter fat,
 solid non-fats,
 added water,
 temperature of milk,
 protein content,
 and corrected lactometer coefficient.
 Taking a sample is non-destructive and takes about 30 to 50 seconds depending on the temperature of the milk.

The milk analyzers will be delivered with clear Standard Operating Procedure advising MCCs and MCC staff will be trained.
 We collaborate with the DDA to set up a system to monitor the milk analyzers and its use.
 In particular,
 DDA technicians will visit treatment MCCs at set periods.
 We also set up a hotline that MCCs can contact in case of problems with the milk analyzers.
 We also make sure that,
 over the course of the project,
 equipment is adequately cleaned and calibrated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the milk analyzers,
 the MCC level treatment also consists of a digitized system to keep track of milk quantity and quality delivered to the MCC.
 To do so,
 we developed a custom Android application that MCCs can use to register farmers that deliver milk.
 For these farmers,
 MCC managers can then record milk deliveries,
 including quantities delivered and price agreed,
 as well as a range of quality parameters that can be read from milk analyzer,
 such as butter fat and protein content.
 The application can also provide MCC managers with simple reports,
 such as the average butter fat (weighted by quantities supplied) over a different period (today,
 yesterday,
 last week,
 last two weeks and custom data range).
 Reports by farmer are also possible,
 such that MCC managers can determine the total sum to be paid to a farmer for milk delivered in the last 14 days.
 The application,
 which is pre-installed on a Samsung galaxy tab A7 with sim-card for mobile internet,
 backs up data in the cloud,
 but is designed following an off-line first principle as some MCCs may not have coverage.
 A screenshot of the application can be found in Figure

Finally,
 for the MCC intervention,
 we also developed a poster to be displayed at MCCs informing farmers that the MCC now has a milk analyzer that can determine milk quality for free.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide information to dairy farmers on the parameters and characteristics that processors are looking for and how farmers can produce milk that adheres to these standards,
 we use a short engaging video that demonstrates the inputs and practices that can be used to increase milk quality.
 The use of video has been found to increase technology adoption in different settings,
 although the effectiveness also depends on a range of design attributes

 The ability to depict role models in videos seems important to increase both aspirations of the person targeted,

To design the video based extension intervention,
 we first identified the top five practices and inputs that are known to raise butter fat and Solid Non Fats in milk.
 This was done through consultations of experts.
 We found the top 5 practices and inputs were:
 selection of breed and genetic potential,
 selection of grasses for high-quality forage,
 best practice in silage and hay making,
 correct mixing and dosage of feed,
 and feed supplements like Methionine and Lysine.
 To make the information intervention more actionable,
 we also provide farmers with some free inputs (1 kg of Chloris Gayana also known as Rhodes grass).
 The video will be screened a first time during baseline data collection and a second time just before the distribution of the milk analyzers.
 We also developed an appealing handout that summarizes some of the main points from the video using cartoons drawn by a local artist.

 we may still want to try boosting power by pooling observations across the orthogonal treatment in the event that we find a treatment effect that appears smaller than the minimal detectable effect size that we assumed during power calculations.
 To do so,
 we will consider the orthogonal treatment as a co-variate we adjust for,
 and interact the treatment variable with the demeaned orthogonal treatment.
 This give a more robust version of the treatment estimate that corresponds to the coefficient estimate of the treatment of interest after dropping the interaction with orthogonal treatment

\begin_layout Section*
Power calculations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also use simulation to determine sample size.
 The primary outcome variable that we use in our statistical power calculations is the price of milk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start at the level of the milk collection center and assume that at this level,
 the price at which milk collection centers sell their aggregated milk is normally distributed with mean 1000 UGX per liter and standard deviation of 50 (which is half of what we will assume at the farmer level).
 From these 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 observations (with 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 denoting the number of milk collection centers recruited for our study and hence the first key variable to be determined by the power calculations) we then generate 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 times 
\emph on
n
\emph default
 observations.
 These are the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
 dairy farmers that are located in the catchment areas of the 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 milk collection centers.
 The outcome variable at this level,
 prices that farmers obtain from milk collection centers,
 are generated again as random normal,
 but with the mean the value that was drawn for the MCC the 
\emph on
n
\emph default
 farmers are connected to,
 and with a slightly higher standard deviation (100 â€”
 since,
 as the milk is not aggregated yet,
 extreme values are not yet averaged out).
 This procedure gives us a total sample with 
\emph on
N
\emph default
 prices at the MCC level and 
\emph on
N.n
\emph default
 prices at the farmer level,
 the latter being clustered at the MCC catchment area level by design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that the intervention at the level of the milk collection centers leads to an increase in the price of UGX30 per liter.
 This seems reasonable in light of the fact that processors told that they either pay a 10 percent premium for quality milk,
 or UGX100 per liter.
 However,
 as we assume a pretty narrow distribution of prices,
 even though this effect is only a 3 percent increase,
 this is considered a medium to large effect according to Cohen's D.
 At the level of the farmers,
 for the intervention at the MCC level,
 we expect an effect size of UGX40.
 While this represents a 4.4 percent increase,
 the larger variance at this level means that according to Cohen's D,
 this effect is considered small to medium.
 Finally,
 at the level of the farmers,
 the individual level randomization of the information treatment intervention allows us to estimate small effects.
 For our power simulation,
 we assumed and effect size of UGX25,
 which corresponds to a small effect according to Cohen's D.
 For the interaction,
 we assume a large effect (UGX50 per liter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We calculate power for the joint test that the three hypotheses are true at the 5 percent significance level.
 To do so,
 we run the exact two regressions from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and run 1000 simulations for each

\emph default
 combination.
 For each

 we calculate the share of simulations at which all coefficients of interest in Equations

 Instead of the usual power curves that plot power against sample size,
 we obtain a power plane as we determine both the number of clusters (between 100 and 130 MCCs) and the number of farmers per cluster (between 10 and 40 farmers).
 Power is measured on the 
\emph on

 shows the trade-off between more clusters and more individuals per cluster.
 With about 125 MCCs and 20 farmers per cluster we find power just above .80.
 This corresponds to a sample of 2500.
 Note that the requirement to detect minimum effect sizes for all three hypotheses simultaneously is very strict.
 For instance,
 if we require only one hypothesis to be significant,
 we obtain power of .99 for a sample with 125 MCCs and 20 farmers.
 Similarly,
 if we consider each hypothesis separately,
 we get power levels of .87 for the MCC level intervention with outcome at the MCC level,
 .93 for the MCC level intervention with outcome at the farmer level,
 and .94 for the farmer level intervention with outcome at the farmer level.
 For the interaction effect,
 we obtain power of .99.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Timeline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to collect baseline information in November-December 2022.
 During that time,
 we will also implement the intervention at the level of the farmer.
 Immediately after baseline data collection,
 we will also start installing lactoscans in the selected milk collection centers.
 This is expected to take about three months,
 such that all lactoscans are install towards the end of March 2023.
 Midline data will be collected about half a year after the last lactoscan was installed,
 so this will be in September-October 2023.
 Endline data will be collected one year after the intervention,
 which is April 2024.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start from a list of registered milk collection centers that was obtained from the Dairy Development Authority.
 From this list,
 we randomly selected 130 milk collection centers,
 half of which were assigned to the treatment group using a computer algorithm.
 We then travel to these 130 milk collection centers and use systematic sampling to get a sample of 10 farmers that are directly delivering to the MCC and 10 farmers that are delivering through a trader to the MCC.
 In particular,
 we will visit the MCC early in the morning and get an estimate of the expected number of farmers that will visit during the course of the day.
 This will be used to determine the interval at which farmers will be picked to participate in the study.
 These farmers will be interviewed at home the next day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Data collection protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Baseline data collection will be fairly straightforward and consist of surveys at the MCC level and at the farmers level.
 Endline data collection will consist of reinterviewing the farmers and MCCs from baseline.
 Furthermore,
 during endline,
 we will also measure quality of milk using milk analyzers in a supervised way.
 In particular,
 we will station enumerators in MCCs for two days to supervise that all incoming milk is tested and entered into the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During endline,
 milk analyzers will also be rolled out in control MCCs which will be used to measure milk quality at both the MCC level and at the farmer level.
 As effects of installing milk analyzers may be very quick,
 we only have a limited time window in which differences between treatment and control areas can be measured.
 Furthermore,
 we will also need to be mindful of anticipatory effects.
 That is,
 we will arrive at control MCCs unannounced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In control MCCs,
 enumerators start by interviewing all farmers that are connected to the control MCC.
 Next,
 we will install a milk analyzer,
 register the control MCC in the app,
 and make sure that all milk samples are tested and entered into the system for two days.
 At the start of the first day,
 the MCC level survey will be implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In treatment MCCs,
 enumerators will also supervise entry during two days.
 The same order of interviewing will be followed.
 In this way,
 we can identify the entries in the Android application that were subjected to supervised entry (two days starting from the MCC level interview).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Milk quality (butter fat content and SNF):
 This will be done by defining a time window (eg two days) where an enumerator will be present in the MCC and systematically test incoming milk (eg every 10th sample brought in).
 Quality is measured by butter fat,
 added water,
 SNF,
 and proteins.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition,
 we will use the data that is submitted through the app to assess impact.
 For instance we will compare the evolution of parameters of samples that are submitted (added water,
 SNF,
 butter fat,
 price) between treatment and control over time.
 We expect that especially immediately after the installation of the milk analyzers in the control MCCs,
 difference between treatment and control will be large,
 and that this difference will disappear over time as farmers and MCCs also upgrade quality as they are now also treated.
 The submitted data will also provide insights on treatment uptake (although it may be that MCC managers use the milk analyzer but not the app).

Transparency and replicability

\begin_layout Standard
To maximize transparency and allow for replicabiliy,
 we use the following strategies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pre-analysis plan:
 the current document provides an ex-ante step-by-step plan setting out the hypothesis we will test,
 the intervention we will implement to test these hypotheses,
 the data that will be collected and specifications we will run to bring the hypotheses to the data.
 This pre-analysis plan will be pre-registered at the AEA RCT registry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
revision control:
 the entire project will be under revision control (that is time stamped track changes) and committed regularly to a public repository (github).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mock report:
 After baseline data is collected,
 a pre-registered report will be produced and added to the AEA RCT registry and GitHub.
 This report will differ from the pre-analyisis plan in that it already has the tables filled with simulated data (drawn from the baseline).
 The idea is that after the endline,
 only minimal changes are necessary (basically connecting a different dataset) to obtain the final result,
 further reducing the opportunity of specification search.
