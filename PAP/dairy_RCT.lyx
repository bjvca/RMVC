Incentivizing quality in the dairy value chain: A pre-analysis plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research design for a randomized control trial of scaling efforts under
 the Quality-Based Milk Payment Scheme (QBMPS) that was piloted by DDA and
 SNV last year in Ugandaâ€™s SW milkshed.

 explore the effect of collective incentives on group production among rural
 Indian dairy cooperatives.
 In a randomized evaluation, they find village-level cooperatives can solve
 internal collective action problems to improve production quality.
 However, some village elites decline payments when they cannot control
 information disclosure.
 Opting out reflects frictions in allocating surplus within a social network,
 and suggests some transparency-based efforts to limit elite capture may
 undermine policy goals.

\begin_layout Standard
We randomly allocate quality testing equipment to eligible milk collection
 centers (MCCs), which agree to implement some kind of quality bonus to
 suppliers.
 In a cross-cutting design, at the farmer level, we will randomly allocate
 training on quality parameters and linkages with production management
 decisions, as well as distribute lactometers, which serve as partial quality
 indicators.

Data collection and endpoints

\begin_layout Standard
Outcomes of interest at MCC level: average milk quality levels (for different
 quality parameters); milk purchase price and volume; milk sales channel
 (to whom sold), price, volume and profits.
 Outcomes of interest at farmer level: perceptions of control of output
 quality parameters; willingness to experiment; changes in production investment
s and management; milk quality levels (for different quality parameters);
 milk sales channel (to whom sold), price, volume and profits.

Transparency and replicability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To maximize transparency and allow for replicabiliy, we use the following
 stratgies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pre-analysis plan: the current document provides an ex-ante step-by-step
 plan setting out the hypothesis we will test, the intervention we will
 implement to test these hypothsis, the data tha will be collected and specifica
tions we will run to bring the hypotheses to the data.
 This pre-analysis plan will be pre-registered at the AEA RCT registry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
revision control: the entire project will be under revision control (that
 is time stamped track changes) and committed regularly to a public repository
 (github).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mock report: After baseline data is collected, a pre-registered report will
 be produced and added to the AEA RCT registry and GitHub.
 This report will differ from the pre-analyisis plan in that it already
 has the tables filled with simulated data (drawn from the baseline).
 The idea is that after the endline, only minimal changes are necessary
 (basically connecting a different dataset) to obtain the final result,
 further reducing the opportunity of specification search.
