  abstract = {Abstract Driven by increased demand from both local and export markets and facilitated by far-reaching liberalization and privatization policies, the dairy sub-sector in Uganda has undergone significant changes in the last decade. With a comparative advantage in milk production, the southwest of Uganda has started to attract considerable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in processing capacity, mainly targeting the export market. As a result, processing capacity increased five-fold and dairy became Uganda's third most important export product, coming from negligible amounts a decade earlier. In this study, we use data collected at different nodes within the value chain to identify some of the key innovations in these value chains. This is done by comparing the area that received the bulk of FDI to a similar area that did not. Furthermore, we also provide an econometric analysis that focuses on the integration of value chain actors into modern value chains more broadly defined. We find that dairy value chains are transforming rapidly, but innovations are more pronounced in areas that received the bulk of FDI. Our analysis further underscores the importance of milk collection centers, which often take the form of farmer cooperatives, in providing many of the support services that enable other actors in the value chain to produce sufficient milk, and maintain milk sanitation levels necessary for a modern export sector to emerge.},

  abstract = {Misalignment of quality incentives along value chains may limit quality and therefore function as a barrier to smallholder participation in modern value chains. This article uses survey and administrative data to study how individual quality incentives provided by private actors can help smallholders to improve milk quality. By matching farmers on baseline characteristics, I find that individual quality incentives increased the compositional quality of milk quickly after its introduction. Together with physical inputs and training, individual quality incentives also increased the hygienic quality of milk. Decreasing hygienic quality over time by treated farmers suggests that the impact of the intervention decreased over time.},

  year     = {Working Paper},
  abstract = {Pre-Analysis Plans (PAPs) for randomized evaluations are becoming increasingly common in Economics, but their definition remains unclear and their practical applications therefore vary\&nbsp;widely. Based on our collective experiences as researchers and editors, we articulate a set of\&nbsp;principles for the ex-ante scope and ex-post use of PAPs. We argue that the key benefits of a PAP can usually be realized by completing the registration fields in the AEA RCT Registry. Specific cases where more detail may be warranted include when subgroup analysis is expected to be particularly important, or a party to the study has a vested interest. However, a strong norm for more detailed pre-specification can be detrimental to knowledge creation when implementingfield experiments in the real world. An ex-post requirement of strict adherence to pre-specified\&nbsp;plans, or the discounting of non-pre-specified work, may mean that some experiments do not take place, or that interesting observations and new theories are not explored and reported. Rather, we recommend that the final research paper be written and judged as a distinct object from the {\textquotedblleft}results of the PAP{\textquotedblright}; to emphasize this distinction, researchers could consider producing a short, publicly available report (the {\textquotedblleft}populated PAP{\textquotedblright}) that populates the PAP to the extent possible and briefly discusses any barriers to doing so.},

  abstract = {Abstract In emerging markets for high-value food products in developing countries, processing companies search for efficient ways to source raw material of high quality. One widely embraced approach is contract farming. But relatively little is known about the appropriate design of financial incentives in a small farm context. We use the example of the Vietnamese dairy sector to analyze the effectiveness of existing contracts between a processor and smallholder farmers in terms of incentivizing the production of high quality milk. A framed field experiment is conducted to evaluate the impact of two incentive instruments, a price penalty for low quality and a bonus for consistent high quality milk, on farmers’ investment in quality-improving inputs. Statistical analysis suggests that the penalty drives farmers into higher input use, resulting in better output quality. The bonus payment generates even higher quality milk. We also find that input choice levels depend on farmers’ socio-economic characteristics such as wealth, while individual risk preferences seem to be less important. Implications for the design of contracts with smallholders are discussed.},
