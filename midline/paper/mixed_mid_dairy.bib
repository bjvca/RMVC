  abstract = {Smallholder producers in developing countries often collaborate in teams that take advantage of scale economies and allocate surplus among members. We experimentally evaluate team-level incentive contracts for quality upgrading among Indian dairy cooperatives where there is a risk of free-riding because individual quality cannot be traced. Incentives improve aggregate quality, with evidence of increased effort from both producers and cooperative managers. However, several managers decline incentive payments when they cannot control how payment information is disclosed to cooperative members. Survey evidence indicates publicity lowers managerial returns, suggesting transparency-based efforts to constrain elites can undermine the core policy goal.},

  abstract = {Misalignment of quality incentives along value chains may limit quality and therefore function as a barrier to smallholder participation in modern value chains. This article uses survey and administrative data to study how individual quality incentives provided by private actors can help smallholders to improve milk quality. By matching farmers on baseline characteristics, I find that individual quality incentives increased the compositional quality of milk quickly after its introduction. Together with physical inputs and training, individual quality incentives also increased the hygienic quality of milk. Decreasing hygienic quality over time by treated farmers suggests that the impact of the intervention decreased over time.},

  abstract = {Abstract In emerging markets for high-value food products in developing countries, processing companies search for efficient ways to source raw material of high quality. One widely embraced approach is contract farming. But relatively little is known about the appropriate design of financial incentives in a small farm context. We use the example of the Vietnamese dairy sector to analyze the effectiveness of existing contracts between a processor and smallholder farmers in terms of incentivizing the production of high quality milk. A framed field experiment is conducted to evaluate the impact of two incentive instruments, a price penalty for low quality and a bonus for consistent high quality milk, on farmers’ investment in quality-improving inputs. Statistical analysis suggests that the penalty drives farmers into higher input use, resulting in better output quality. The bonus payment generates even higher quality milk. We also find that input choice levels depend on farmers’ socio-economic characteristics such as wealth, while individual risk preferences seem to be less important. Implications for the design of contracts with smallholders are discussed.},

  abstract = {{Differences in world market participation and access to value-chain technologies have resulted in uneven experiences across countries. In this paper, we explore their impact on prices in the value chain, using the examples of Ethiopia and Uganda. We first develop a conceptual framework, and then validate the model using primary price data collected at several levels in the dairy value chains in both countries. We find that prices are lower in Uganda than in Ethiopia, reflecting their respective net trade status. Moreover, despite shorter value chains, we find much more significant effects of distance from the capital on milk prices in Ethiopia than in Uganda. This is linked to the presence of milk chilling centers in Uganda. While such technology is important for milk quality, we find here that it also has the added benefit to reduce the impact of farmers’ remoteness on prices and allows for more geographically extended value chains.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Firms who sell regional or specialty products often share a collective reputation based on aggregate quality. Collective reputation can be approached as a dynamic common property resource problem. We show that for an experience good without firm traceability, individual firms have the incentive to choose quality levels that are sub-optimal for the group. These results support minimum quality standards. Trigger strategies are analyzed as an alternative solution to this problem. Finally, the implications of these results are discussed as they relate to the case study of Washington apples.},
